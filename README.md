# Welcome to my portfolio project. 

### I chose to analyze a dataset on international migrants and refugees across the world by the United Nations taken from Kaggle. This data resonates with my lived experience as I had to migrate from my home country. From this analysis, I hope you will take away more consideration and empathy towards the increasing number of international migrants in the face of many hardships from war, economic crises, as well as financial and legal constraints that limit their access to education and work opportunities. I want to use this dataset to advocate on behalf of international migrants who are talented and seeking opportunities to contribute their skills in their new host communities. These individuals are skilled and ambitious and they deserve opportunities that will utilize their skills.

### While I’ve used Python to perform this analysis, I am also skilled in SQL and R. I’ve completed an extensive four month job-ready Google Data Analytics Career Certificate, where I’ve demonstrated hands-on experience with data cleaning, data visualization, interpreting data analytics findings into clear insights. I have a solid understanding of databases and have created and organized databases with my research findings. I am actively seeking a Data Analyst role and I would be grateful for your consideration of my skills for a role with your organization.

### Used python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) to use data analysis to explore International Migrants
